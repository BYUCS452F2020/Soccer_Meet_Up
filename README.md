# Soccer_Meet_Up

Soccer Meet Up:

This project is an app for finding drop-in soccer games nearby. Users can set up soccer games or look for games that have already been set up. It's a great way to find team members or a group to play with. This will make setting up casual games easier.

Group:
We have 2 group members. We are open to having one more. 

No SQL Database:
MySQL

Business Aspect:
We want to focus on getting the word out and building a group of users first.
Once we have enough users we may begin advertising more heavily and we may try to get advertisements from soccer gear supply companies. 

Legal Aspect:
We will make protecting users and their information a priority. We will also encourage users to follow all local laws related to playing on private and public property etc. 

Technical Aspect: 
We will make an Android app for the front-end and we will use a local database for now for the back-end.
